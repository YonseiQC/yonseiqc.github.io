We believe quantum computing represents one of the most profound shifts in the history of computation. Our group is driven by the conviction that building reliable, large-scale quantum computers requires advances across all layers — from the physical understanding of many-body quantum systems, to the design of algorithms that unlock quantum advantage, to the fault-tolerant architectures that make it all practical. We pursue foundational research at the intersection of these challenges, with the goal of turning the promise of quantum computing into reality.
